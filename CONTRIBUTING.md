## Development Process

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/github-star-tracker.git
   cd github-star-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Requires Node.js 24+ and pnpm
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
   # Or: fix/issue-123
   # Or: docs/improve-readme
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Make your changes**
   ```bash
   # Edit files using your favorite editor
   ```

2. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   # Run all checks
   pnpm run validate
   
   # Or individually:
   pnpm run test          # Unit tests
   pnpm run test:coverage # Tests with coverage report
   pnpm run typecheck     # Type checking
   pnpm run check         # Linting + type checking
   ```

3. **Test your changes locally**
   ```bash
   # Build the action
   pnpm run build
   
   # Test in a real workflow (create .github/workflows/test.yml)
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add support for custom data branch names"
   ```

### Code Style

We use **Biome** for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check code style
pnpm run check

# Auto-fix issues
pnpm run format
```

**Guidelines:**
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Functional programming style preferred
- No `any` types (use `unknown` if needed)
- Functions with 2+ parameters should use destructured named parameters
- Constants for magic numbers/strings
- Comprehensive JSDoc for public APIs

### Testing

All features should include tests:

```typescript
// src/feature.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { myFeature } from './feature';

describe('myFeature', () => {
  it('should do something correctly', () => {
    const result = myFeature({ input: 'test' });
    expect(result).toBe('expected');
  });
});
```

**Test requirements:**
- ✅ Unit tests for all functions
- ✅ Integration tests for complex flows
- ✅ Minimum 80% code coverage
- ✅ Tests must pass before merging

Run tests:
```bash
pnpm run test              # Run once
pnpm run test:watch        # Watch mode
pnpm run test:coverage     # With coverage report
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

This project uses [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) for automated versioning and releases. **Following these commit conventions is mandatory.**

### Commit Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

| Type | Description | Version Bump | Example |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | Minor (1.0.0 → 1.1.0) | `feat: add email notification support` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | Patch (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) | `fix: resolve chart rendering in emails` |
| `docs` | Documentation only | None | `docs: update installation guide` |
| `style` | Code style/formatting | None | `style: fix indentation` |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring | None | `refactor: simplify chart generation` |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | Patch | `perf: optimize star fetching` |
| `test` | Adding/updating tests | None | `test: add email tests` |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | None | `chore: update dependencies` |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | None | `ci: add release workflow` |
| `build` | Build system changes | None | `build: update esbuild config` |
| `revert` | Revert previous commit | Depends | `revert: feat: add feature X` |

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, use `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```bash
# Option 1: ! after type
git commit -m "feat!: change configuration structure"

# Option 2: Footer
git commit -m "feat: redesign API

BREAKING CHANGE: Config file now uses YAML instead of JSON.
Users must migrate their configuration files."
```

**Result:** Major version bump (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

### Commit Examples

**Good commits:**
```bash
feat(charts): add comparison chart for top repositories
fix(email): resolve SMTP authentication with Gmail
docs: add troubleshooting guide to wiki
perf(api): reduce GitHub API calls by 50%
test(tracking): add integration tests for star tracking
chore(deps): update @actions/core to v1.11.1
```

**Bad commits:**
```bash
update stuff                    # ❌ Not descriptive
Fix bug                         # ❌ Doesn't follow format
added new feature               # ❌ Wrong tense (use imperative)
feat add charts                 # ❌ Missing colon
WIP                             # ❌ Not descriptive at all
```

### Commit Scope (Optional)

Scope provides additional context:

```bash
feat(charts): add new chart type
fix(email): resolve rendering issue
docs(wiki): add PAT setup guide
test(tracking): add edge case tests
```

**Common scopes:**
- `charts`: Chart generation
- `email`: Email notifications
- `tracking`: Star tracking logic
- `config`: Configuration handling
- `i18n`: Internationalization
- `data`: Data management

### Multi-line Commits

For complex changes:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(charts): add interactive charts with drill-down

- Added click handlers for chart elements
- Implemented tooltip with repository details
- Added chart legend customization
- Updated documentation with examples

Closes #123"
```

### Automated Releases

When you merge to `main`:
1. semantic-release analyzes commits since last release
2. Determines version bump based on commit types
3. Updates `package.json` automatically
4. Generates `CHANGELOG.md` from commits
5. Creates git tag and GitHub release
6. Updates `v1` major version tag

**No manual versioning needed!**

> [!TIP]
> **Path aliases:** Cross-layer imports use `@application/*`, `@config/*`, `@domain/*`, `@i18n`, `@infrastructure/*`, `@presentation/*`. Same-layer imports use relative paths. Tests are co-located as `*.test.ts` files next to the source.


## Development Tips

### Testing Your Action Locally

Create a test workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-local.yml
name: Test Local Changes
on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ./  # Uses local action code
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_STAR_TRACKER_TOKEN }}
```

### Debugging

```typescript
// Use console.log for debugging (captured in workflow logs)
console.log('Debug info:', { variable, state });

// Use @actions/core for action logs
import * as core from '@actions/core';
core.debug('Detailed debug info');
core.info('General information');
core.warning('Warning message');
core.error('Error message');
```

### Common Issues

**Tests failing?**
```bash
# Clear cache and retry
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install
pnpm run validate
```

**TypeScript errors?**
```bash
# Check types
pnpm run typecheck

# Ensure dependencies are current
pnpm install
```

**Formatting issues?**
```bash
# Auto-fix all formatting
pnpm run format
```

## Use of AI

If you use AI tools when contributing:

- **Review all generated code**: You are responsible for the code you submit
- **Test thoroughly**: AI-generated code must pass all existing tests and include new tests where appropriate
- **Disclose significant AI usage**: If an entire feature or module was AI-generated, mention it in the PR description
- **Don't blindly copy**: Understand what the code does before submitting

AI is a tool, not a substitute for understanding the codebase.
